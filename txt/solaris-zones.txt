================================
Solaris Zones (Linux Containers)
================================
- Solaris Zones use the "Global Zone's" operating system as the host for a spearate "jailed" set of processes

Zones file: /etc/zones
Zone States: undefined, configured, installed

Zone Admin Tool: zoneadm
zoneadm options: halt; shutdown; reboot; ready

List Zones
----------
zoneadm list -cv

Connect to a Zone
-----------------
As root: zlogin <zone_name>

Reboot a Zone
-------------
1. Log into the global zone.
2. Become root
3. List the system's zones
   # zoneadm list -cv
4. Reboot selected zone
   # zoneadm -z <zone> reboot
5. Verify the zone is back up
   # zoneadm list -v

If a zone is outside of its global and isn't pingable after a reboot, if the server is running NIS+ try invalidating the NIS+ cache
on the global zone host and and try rebooting again.
    # ps -ef | grep cache
    # kill <cache PID>
    # zoneadm -z <zone> boot
