Single User Mode Boot
=====================
Boot from CD-ROM to Single User Mode - SPARC
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Press <ESC>-<SHIFT>-<B> after the memory check to get to the command line
2. Boot from CD-ROM to Single User Mode: boot cdrom -s
3. Make directory to mount the disk.  Note: cdrom mounts to /tmp/root: cd /tmp/root; mkdir test
4. Mount cdrom to a disk: mount /dev/dsk/c1t2d0s0 /tmp/root/test
5. Change shell and set terminal variable: /bin/bash; export TERM=vt100

Boot from CD-ROM to Single User Mode - X86
------------------------------------------------------
1. Insert boot DVD into DVD drive (or an external DVD drive)
2. Reboot, and press F2 at the first visible BIOS screen
3. In the BIOS change the first boot drive to your chosen DVD drive.  Then save settings and reboot again.
4. At the Grub screen, choose the “Solaris” entry if you’re using an attached K-V-M,
    or option 2 if you’re using a serial console.
    5. Sync the filesystems when prompted
    6. Choose the local partition you wish to repair
    7. Set your shell variables: export TERM=vt100; export EDITOR=vi; stty erase <BKSP>
    8. When complete, I recommend leaving the BIOS in this configuration for future break/fix operations.



ZFS  Single User Mode -- Working file system
----------------------------------------------------
Press <ESC>-<SHIFT>-<B> after the memory check to get to the command line
 - SPARC: boot -F failsafe
 - x86: Select <failsafe> from the GRUB prompt
Mount ZFS BE on /a when prompted.  You will see:
 .
 .
 .
 ROOT /zfsBE was found on rpool
 Do you wish to have it mounted read-write on /a? [y,n,?]

Change to /a/etc/ directory: cd /a/etc
Configure environments: TERM=vt100; export TERM
Edit passwd or shadow file
Reboot: init 6

ZFS  Single User Mode -- Not working file system
--------------------------------------------------------
Press <ESC>-<SHIFT>-<B> after the memory check to get to the command line
 - SPARC: boot cdrom -s
 - x86: Select <boot> from the local CD option
Mount rpool: zpool import -R /a rpool
Mount ZFS BE: zfs mount rpool/ROOT/zfsBE
Change to /a directory: cd /a
Configure environments: TERM=vt100; export TERM
Perform file system clean up or ZFS recovery steps
Reboot: init 6

Solaris Disk Partitions
-------------------------
Disk partitions are in /dev/dsk/ and are numbered: c?t?d?s?
List partitions: Run the format command;  Then select a disk, 0 thru ?;  Enter "p" or "partition"; Type "p" or "print" to display slice information; "q" to quit
- The "tag" will tell you which partitions correspond to /etc/vfstab entries.  i.e. "root" is the root partition.  "unassigned" means unused.
Check for ZFS root pool (zpool): zpool list
Mount non-ZFS disk partitions: mount -o <ro or rw> /dev/dsk/<partition> /<mount point>
Mount ZFS root partition: zpool import -f rpool 

Solaris Single User Mode for expired root password
-----------------------------------------------------------
Run the "Boot from CD-ROM to Single User Mode" procedure
Identify the root partition: i.e. c0t3d0s0
Mount root to /a as read/write: mount -o rw /dev/dsk/c0t3d0s0 /a
Configure environment: cd /a/etc/; TERM=vt100; export TERM
Replace root's password entry with a working password hash
cd /
umount /a
Reboot: init 6
